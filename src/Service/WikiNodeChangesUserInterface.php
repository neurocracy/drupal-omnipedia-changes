   * places in Drupal core check User::isAuthenticated(), a method which returns
   * true only if the user ID (uid) is greater than 0; a user that has not yet
   * been saved to the database will always return false. Attempting to build a
   * solution that tricks Drupal into thinking a temporary user is authenticated
   * would likely be overengineering and could introduce unforeseen implications
   * for security.
